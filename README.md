# Tank Game

A retro tank game, with procedurally generated maps and AI that autonomously navigates the world. Contains audio with music and effects.

This game was created by me as a tutorial for teaching the basics of Unity and programming. The videos series can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFmk-M1Mk5M&list=PL4tmg17BWmAOzt_lpVrOWn2tsa7-bQRMu&index=1).

Made with Unity version 2019.1.6f1
